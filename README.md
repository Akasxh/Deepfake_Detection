Paper 3 Key Features: AEROBLADE (autoencoder reconstruction-based latent diffusion detection)

- Reconstruction Error-Based Detection: Utilizes discrepancies in reconstruction accuracy to detect generated images with high precision.

- No Training Required: Unlike other methods, AEROBLADE does not rely on extensive model training, making it simple and efficient.

- Will help in detection of image generated by LDMs specifically due to their usage of  the low-resolution latent space of a pre-trained autoencoder
